## 14 - Empty Promises

<span style='font-family: Bahnschrift;'>

I would like to dedicate this final discussion to vacuous statements - statements that are true *by default* - or by lack of counterexamples.

Let me show you.

Suppose you have an empty bucket. Consider the statement `all balls in this bucket are blue`. Is this statement true or false?

Well, can you produce a ball from the bucket that *isn't* blue? No, of course not. Thus the statement must be true.

Now you could argue that one cannot produce a blue ball either. But get this, my statement was `if a ball is in this bucket, it is blue`. You *cannot* disprove it, because doing so would require you to produce a counterexample from the bucket. And as we know, the bucket is empty. Hence there are no counterexamples.

Vacuous statements have the form $\forall \space r, P(r) \implies Q(r)$. The difference is that $r$ either comes from an empty collection, or for every $r$, $\neg P(r)$ holds. (Recall the equivalent of an implication).

Have some more examples
1. Every even injective function from $\mathbb R$ to itself is continuous

1. Every skew-symmetric nonzero $1\times 1$ matrix is invertible.

1. Every even integer of the form $24k+13$ is a perfect square

and so on. This is important because sometimes, it could be the case that a forall statement is vacuously true, but you use it the wrong way.

I really don't have any examples for this.

If you come across some examples, do let me know, because this concludes our discussion. If you encounter any typos or logical inconsistencies, *do* let me know, this is still a work in progress.

I hope these were helpful. Cya.
