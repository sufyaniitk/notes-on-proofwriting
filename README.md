# notes-on-proofwriting

This is a series of notes on logic and proofwriting that are meant to serve as a foundation for both. Logic and proofwriting essentially form the entirety of the gap between high school and grad level mathematics.

This series of notes is entirely my original work (well, except the proofs that I have presented), and is dedicated to the stuudents of IIT Kanpur. Regardless, it is a freely available resource for anyone to use and suggest modifications and/or additions (although I believe foundationally the content covered is sufficient).

The code for $\LaTeX$ images can be found on [this](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6637c5a6a660b9f74ff8aceb) Overleaf project.

For a better overall experience, I suggest any readers access the files within VSCode or Obsidian, as the GitHub flavor has a few differences that are overall minor but inconvenient.
