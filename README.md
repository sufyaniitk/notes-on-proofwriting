# notes-on-proofwriting

This is a series of notes on logic and proofwriting that are meant to serve as a basic foundation for both. Logic and proofwriting essentially form the entirety of the gap between high school and grad level mathematics, and I'm aiming to not exactly bridge it, but help students take the first step across the ravine.

This series of notes is entirely my original work (well, except the proofs that I have presented), and is dedicated to the students of IIT Kanpur. Regardless, it is a freely available resource for anyone to use and suggest modifications and/or additions to (although I believe foundationally the content covered is sufficient).

The code for $\LaTeX$ images can be found on [this](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6637c5a6a660b9f74ff8aceb) Overleaf project.

For a better overall experience, I suggest any readers access the files within VSCode or Obsidian, as the GitHub markdown flavor has a few problems that are overall minor but downgrade the experience.

I would also like to point out GitHub displays file names alphabetically - but indeed, the (intended) reading order is N1 - N14.

That's all, hope these turn out helpful.
